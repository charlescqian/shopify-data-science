However, there are a few very large orders where 2000 units are being ordered at once, with an order value of \\\\$704,000. These are all from a single customer/user with user_id 607. These are likely wholesale orders. There also seems to be a very expensive item in which each unit costs \\\\$25,725. These two points are definite outliers and they are the cause of AOV being higher than expected. \n",

For now, let's define any orders with an order_amount of over \\\\$10,000 to be wholesale. "

This is a good metric because it allows the business operator to better allocate their resources, such as marketing or customer relationship management. For example, if they want more of their revenue to come from retail sales, they can increase spending in marketing and promotions. On the other hand, if they rely on wholesale for the majority of the revenue, then perhaps they would like to improve their customer relationship management to ensure the wholesale customers keep coming back."
